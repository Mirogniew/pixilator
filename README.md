## Pixilator - premise
In recent years Pixelart rose into popularity. But not everyone has ability
to make pixel pictures just by thinking about how to do it. That's where Pixilator
comes in - this will be the tool, that takes a file in some common picture extension
like *.png or *.bmp, makes user defined grid on it and colours every cell 
according to the most prominent colour in it. It will also have optional
login option.
